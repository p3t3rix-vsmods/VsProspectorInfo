# ProspectTogether

This is a fork of the awesome ProspectorInfo Mod from P3t3rix (https://github.com/p3t3rix-vsmods/VsProspectorInfo)
ProspectTogether aims to make it easy to share prospecting data when playing on a server.
You can also use this mod in single player.
The only downside compared to ProspectorInfo is that this mod also needs to be installed on the server.

## Installation
Just drop the file into your `Mods` folder.

## Migration from ProspectorInfo

This mod will automatically import existing prospecting data from the ProspectorInfo mod.
To be more specific, in the `%Vintage_Story_Data%/ModData/YourWorldId/` directory, it will copy the file `vsprospectorinfo.data` to `prospectTogetherClient.json`.
Note that there have been cases, where ProspectorInfo was unable to parse the output of the Prospecting Pick.
These entries cannot be imported. So you might have to prospect some chunks again.

If you want to share your existing prospecting data with other players on the server, use `.pt sendall`.
This will send all your prospecting data to the server and all other players. You only have to do this once.
The server stores this information in `%Vintage_Story_Data%/ModData/YourWorldId/prospectTogetherServer.json`
If you also want to share newly added prospecting data in the future, enable autosharing. 
You can do this either via the dialog on the map (use `.pt showgui` to open it if it is missing) or by using `.pt autoshare true`.
Note that autosharing is enabled by default, but you might want to disable it on a PvP server.


## Client Commands

    .pt - main command for the mod and the default sub-command is to 'showoverlay'
    .pt showoverlay [true,false] - Show or hide the overlay on the map. Toggles without argument.
    .pt showborder [true,false] - Show or hide the border around chunks. Toggles without argument.
    .pt showgui [true,false] - Show the GUI where you can configure the mode (default or heatmap) and select the ore that should be heatmapped.
    .pt setcolor (overlay|border|lowheat|highheat) [0-255] [0-255] [0-255] [0-255] - Sets the color of the respective element.
    .pt setborderthickness [1-5] - Sets the border thickness. 
    .pt mode [0-1] - Sets the map mode. Supported modes: 0 (Default) and 1 (Heatmap)
    .pt heatmapore [oreName] - Changes the heatmap mode to display a specific ore.
        No argument resets the heatmap back to all ores. Can only handle the ore name in your selected language or the ore tag.
        Examples: game:ore-emerald, game:ore-bituminouscoal, Cassiterite.
    .pt autoshare [true,false] - Set automatic sharing of prospecting data.
    .pt setsaveintervalminutes [1-60] - Periodically store the prospecting data (on the cleint) every x minutes.
    .pt sendall - Send all your existing prospecting information to the server. You usually only have to run this command once per server.

### Server Configuration

    SaveIntervalMinutes [1-60] - Periodically store the prospecting data every x minutes. Default: 5

## Usage

Whenever you finish prospecting a chunk, the data is saved into the ModData folder and added to the chunk info of the world map. 

Additionally, if you enabled autosharing, the data is also sent to the server, where it is also stored and sent to all players.

The mod renders a transparent square of all chunks that have been prospected. If a chunk is re-prospected, the message is simply overwritten. The rendering of these squares can be toggled with the .pt command.

After prospecting, the info will be displayed in the tooltip of the minimap when hovering over the chunk. This info is stored in `%Vintage_Story_Data%/ModData/YourWorldId/prospectTogetherClient.json`.

On the server side, the info is stored in `%Vintage_Story_Data%/ModData/YourWorldId/prospectTogetherServer.json`.

### Heatmap

A map mode that displays the relative density of the ores on the map via a color gradient. Can be enabled/disabled and switched between displaying the density of just one ore and displaying the density of all ores (The highest density per chunk is picked).

Normal map (map mode 0)

## Compiling
Clone the repository with submodules included: "git clone --recursive"
To compile the mod you also need to set 2 environment variables:
- VINTAGE_STORY => the path to the game directory e.g. c:\games\vintagestory
- VINTAGE_STORY_DATA => the path to the games data directory typically located somewhere in appdata e.g. C:\Users\MyUser\AppData\Roaming\VintagestoryData

## Create a release
To create a release just compile the solution in Release configuration. A folder named "release" should appear in the solution directory.
This can then be zipped to be uploaded to the mod-db.
